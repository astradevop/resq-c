ITS AN INTERVIEW BASED PROJECT
DONT FORGET TO USE VENV
SEPERATE FRONTEND AND BACKEND FOLDERS
SIMPLE BUT GOOD ,CLEAN,STRUCTURED CODE .
EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND SCALE 
JUST FUNCTIONALITY BASED CODES ONLY NO HIGH LEVEL SECURITY BASED CODES .

✅ Final Tech Stack (RESQ – Python Full-Stack, Production-Ready)
🧠 Frontend (Web App)

Next.js (React, App Router) – main frontend

Tailwind CSS – mobile-first UI (your global feature)

Mapbox GL JS – realtime maps, markers, clustering

Socket.IO (client) – realtime updates (SOS, incidents, chat, assignments, broadcasts)

React Query (TanStack Query) – API state + caching

Zustand – global UI state (auth, map filters, role context)

This gives you Uber-like realtime UX with zero refresh.

⚙️ Backend (Python – Realtime Core)

FastAPI – async REST + WebSocket APIs

python-socketio (ASGI mode) – realtime engine (chat, live map, broadcasts)

Uvicorn + Gunicorn – async server stack

PostgreSQL 

SQLAlchemy 2.0 (or SQLModel) – ORM

JWT Auth (access + refresh) – role-based auth (Citizen/Volunteer/Admin)

This combo handles realtime + geo + chat + scale without hacks.
